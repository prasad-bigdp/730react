State:State in react refers to the way of storing and managing the data that changes over time in a component. Simply
   "state is an object that stores the data and can change over time"

** when state value changes the component re-renders to reflex that change in the component.

state can be used in functional components using 'useState' hook. without the hook , functional components are stateless components

syntax :  const [value,setValue] = useState(initialValue)
value is the actual value that can be changed
setValue is an asynchrnous function(a function that some time to execute) to update the state of value

useState is the default hook provided by React. A hook is nothing but a default function.
eg: 
import {useState} from 'react'
function Counter(){
   const [count,setCount]=useState(0)
   return (
      <>
         <p>{count}</p>
         <button onClick={()=>setCount(count+1)}> + </button>
      </>
   )
}
export default Counter;

Major use cases are toggles, form inputs, counters etc.., 


useEffect : useEffect is also hook provided by react by default which is used to perform asynchrnous operations such as fetching the data
'fetch' is the default method provided by Browser to get/post the data to an endpoint(server)
