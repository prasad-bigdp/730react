State:State in react refers to the way of storing and managing the data that changes over time in a component. Simply
   "state is an object that stores the data and can change over time"

** when state value changes the component re-renders to reflex that change in the component.

state can be used in functional components using 'useState' hook. without the hook , functional components are stateless components
