Props: props is a shortcut for properties. Usually we pass properties from parent component to child component. we declare them as attributes and receives them in child component as a 'props' object
   syntax:
   <component propName='value' propName2='value2' />

   function component(props){
    return (
        <>
        <h1>{props.propName}</h1>
        <h2>{props.propName2}</h2>
        </>
    )
   }
    
   features:
     i. All Props are immutable
     ii. props can pass strings, objects,number,boolean,arrays,functions also
     iii. we can even pass HTML UI using props 'children'.
     iv. props always can be passed from parent to child.In Large applications, when multi level components involved, To pass a value from Higher level to lower level , it needs to travel all levels creating a probelm called "Prop Drilling"
