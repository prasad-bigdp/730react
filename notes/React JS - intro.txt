React JS:    
          React JS is a Javascript Library which is used to build user Interfaces. React mostly builds single page Applications and progressive web apps. 
A Javascript Library is nothing but a Pre written code used for specific purpose.
The key difference between Library and Framework is A Library just provides some code for a purpose but frameworks provide complete Architecture of code.
A Single Page Application Loads a specific section of a web page without loading the complete Page.
A Progressive Web APP gives user native app like experience in web apps.

History :
----------
       In 2010 , meta developed the react for internal purposes and to the public in 2012 as open source.

React Architecture:
---------------------------
      React Divides the whole page into reusable components and uses virtual DOM to load them . Basic Key Factors in React are:
      i. components:   React core concept is component.components are the building blocks of react.  it is a piece of code that are reusable UI.
     ii. Virtual DOM :  React uses a virtual DOM ( A lightweight in memory representation of Actual DOM) to optimise rendering and improves performance.
    iii. Data Binding : React follows one way Data Binding that ensures components receives data from parent components


How to do First React APP ?
        1. For React Code, we need a code editor to write react code.(VS Code)
        2. We need a package Manager to download, install, unstall,update packages (libraries) . SO, Download and Install Node Package Manager(npm)
             goto nodejs.org/download and download based on OS
             click next until finish
             goto smd and verify "node -v" and "npm -v"
         3. open vscode, open folder,create folders code,notes,projects
         4. open terminal--->new terminal ---> click arrow and select command prompt
         5. Enter "cd code" . Type "npm create vite@latest appName"
         6. select  'react'  and 'JS' (if asked, ok -- y , package name should not contain uppercase)
         7. cd appName .
             npm install
             npm run dev
     it will run the APP in 5173 port
    
        8. Goto index.html and update title and favicon. Goto App.Jsx and update code as 
            HELLO WORLD 
   
Folder Structure: 
    vite.config.js ---  it is the rule set file for vite
    eslint.config.js --- it is the rule set file for eslint(used for Errors)
    readme.md  --- instruction file
    package.json --- it contains meta data of Application (filename,version,author,scripts,dependencies etc..,)
    package-lock.json --- it contains meta data of package.json
    .gitignore --- it contains files/folders that are ignored by Git
    node modules --- it ocntains all the packages that are needed (installed based on package.json)
    public --- it contains public files which can be accessed anywhere in application
    src --- it contains main 'source'
    index.html ---- it is the main HTML file that loads into web    
    main.jsx --- it is used to access div with id 'root' from index.html and render 'APP' component in it.
    APP.jsx --- it contains the basic jsx code for the screen

JSX : It is the extension of Javascript. JSX allows to write HTML within Javascript. Basic Rules For JSX are
    i. JSX Expressions must return only one parent element
    ii. In JSX, always names follows cameCase(including attributes such as className,htmlFor)
    iii. All tags must be properly closing(including self closing tags eg : <img />)
    iv. Even Style properties follows CamelCase
    v. When Rendering lists,must use 'key' to differentiate each list item.

Conponent : component is the reusable part of User Interface.Every Component Follows JSX structure and the whole screen is divided in a logical Reusable Manner

We can keep one component inside another component called Nested Components
